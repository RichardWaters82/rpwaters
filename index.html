                    <h3>Digital Agency</h3>
                    
                    <p>10 years ago, I co-founded and bootstrapped a digital agency in South Wales, UK. Together we brought technology and creativity together with a unique mix of personality and pride in our endeavours.</p>
                    
                    <p>The agency has grown, has global clients, has handled Â£1.2m+ integrated advertising campaigns and now is part of a group.</p>

                    <h3>Industrial Process Control</h3>
                    
                    <p>Working in heavy and high tech industries on a multitude of projects all involving big machines, oil rigs, trains, cranes and more.</p>
                    
                    <p>My focus here was data, analysis and HMI/SCADA.</p>

                    <h3>Business</h3>
                    <p>10 years as a director and shareholder of a digital agency. With an engineering background this meant learning and defining a whole new skill set in business. I have always prided myself on being able to communicate technical principles easily whilst being personable. Another key skill is being able to hold a view of an entire company and its objectives whilst still planning and tackling projects at a micro-level.</p>

                    <h3>Team Management</h3>
                    <p>Development of small and effective multi-disciplinary teams. These teams can be very flexible, reactive and if managed properly can exceed expectation in terms of output. I am now refining the management models used previously around Kanban and Agile.</p>

                    <p>A successful leader of technology is able to communicate the complex into straight-forward understandable concepts enabling the business to make well-informed decisions and champion growth and efficiency through technology.</p>

                    <h3>Requirements and Architecture</h3>
                    <p>Understanding each business and modelling software to the unique processes is a key skill I have honed. Many make the business fit the software which is counter-intuitive, sometimes businesses just don't fit the mould. Most require multiple solutions that need to be brought together to gather and harness the data available.</p>
